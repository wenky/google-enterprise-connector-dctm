Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Documentum!

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This connector for EMC Documentum Content Server provides access to
documents and document meta-data stored in the Documentum Content
Server developed by the EMC Corporation.

The connector communicates with the Documentum Content Server using
the Java language Documentum Foundation Classes (DFC) library. To
properly build this connector you will need access to the set of DFC
Java classes. DFC is a commercial product offered by the EMC
Corporation and is not included in this distribution.
